HyperCardPreview is an Mac OS X application that can display HyperCard stacks, with an look
very faithful to the original. It makes the stack files alive again in the Finder with
the real icons, so they don't appear as "binaries". There is also a QuickLook plug-in.

You can only visualize the stacks: you can't modify them, you can't execute them. But you
can inspect the stacks, backgrounds, cards, buttons and fields, see the scripts and
get the text contents.

Features:
- can open HyperCard v1 and v2 stacks,
- uses bitmap fonts, so it feels like the old days,
- reads the resources of the stacks to get the icons and fonts,
- programmed in Swift, doesn't use any deprecated API.
